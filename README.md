*Client-server Model - A client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A server can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server


*Cloud Computing Deployment Models
 >cloud-based deployment - Migrate or design & build new applications in the cloud

 >On-premises || private cloud deployment - resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.
 
 >Hybrid Deployment - cloud based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure.
 
*Amazon EC2 instance types

  Ideal for high-performance databases -> Memory optimized

  Suitable for data warehousing applications -> Storage optimized

  Balances compute, memory, and networking resources -> General purpose

  Offers high-performance processors -> Compute optimized


*Amazon EC2 pricing

  Amazon EC2 Savings Plans -> ideal for workloads that involve a consistent amount of compute usage over a 1-year or 3-year term. 
  
 Spot Instances -> Ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions.
 
  
*Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling -> enables you to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to changing application demand, allowing you to maintain a greater sense of application availability.

  >Dynamic scaling - responds to changing demand. 

  >Predictive scaling automatically - schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.

//To scale faster, you can use dynamic scaling and predictive scaling together.

  >Auto Scaling group
  
  +Minimum capacity is the number of Amazon EC2 instances that launch immediately after you have created the Auto Scaling group
  
  +If you do not specify the desired number of Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group, the desired capacity defaults to your minimum capacity.
  
  +Maximum Capacity



*Elastic Load Balancing
